\subsection{Plan the pick-and-place task for the UR5 robot in ROS.}

The pick-and-place task is divided into two phases: scanning and pick-and-place.

The scanning consists of a composition of rectilinear and circular motion primitives that make sure that the camera mounted on the end-effector of the robot covers the whole workspace, detecting all cubes and their destination.

After the cubes and their destinations have been found, the pick-and-place phase is carried out as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Move linearly in Cartesian space towards the cube location.
\item Lower the end-effector onto the cube, close the gripper and then raise the end-effector back up.
\item Move linearly to the home position.
\item Move linearly to the destination.
\item Lower the end-effector, open the gripper and then raise the end-effector back up.
\item Move linearly to the home position.
\end{itemize}
